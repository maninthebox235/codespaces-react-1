## 🔧 Required Setup Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets

The GitHub Actions workflow needs your Supabase credentials to build the app.

**Steps:**
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add these two secrets:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Value: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)

   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - Value: Your Supabase anon/public key

   > 💡 You can find these in your Supabase project settings: https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select: **GitHub Actions**
3. Click **Save**

### 3. Trigger Deployment

**Option A - Automatic (Recommended):**
The workflow will automatically run when you push to main (already triggered!)

**Option B - Manual:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1/actions
2. Click on "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"

### 4. Monitor Deployment

1. Go to: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Watch the build and deploy progress
4. If it fails, check the logs for errors (likely missing secrets)

### 5. Access Your App

Once deployed, your app will be available at:

**🚀 https://maninthebox235.github.io/codespaces-react-1/**

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` secret in GitHub
- [ ] Add `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` secret in GitHub
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages (Source: GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Verify workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Access the deployed app
- [ ] Test the app functionality

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails - Missing Secrets
**Error:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL is not defined`
**Solution:** Add the required secrets in GitHub Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

### Build Fails - Tests Failing
**Solution:** Check the test logs in the Actions tab. Tests should pass locally first.

### 404 Error on Routes
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen as we're using HashRouter, but if it does:
- Ensure `base: '/codespaces-react-1/'` is in vite.config.js
- Check that the deploy path is correct

### App Loads but No Data
**Solution:**
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct in GitHub secrets
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify your Supabase database has the correct schema (run supabase-schema.sql)

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup

If you haven't set up your Supabase database yet:

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://app.supabase.com
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Run the schema from: [supabase-schema.sql](supabase-schema.sql)
4. This creates the `players` and `assessments` tables

---

## 🔄 Future Deployments

After the initial setup, deployments are automatic:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "your message"`
3. Push: `git push origin main`
4. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys!

---

## 📊 Monitoring

- **Actions**: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1/actions
- **Deployments**: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1/deployments
- **Settings**: https://github.com/maninthebox235/codespaces-react-1/settings/pages

---

## 🎉 Next Steps

Once deployed:

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Add some test players and assessments
3. Share the URL with your team
4. Monitor the GitHub Actions for any failed deployments

**Your app will be live at:**
