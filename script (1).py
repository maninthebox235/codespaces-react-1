HOCKEY BASELINE TRACKER - DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
==========================================

You now have a complete web application that can be shared with your organization. Here are your options for deployment:

OPTION 1: SIMPLE FILE SHARING (Easiest)
---------------------------------------
âœ… Best for: Quick testing, small teams

1. Email the hockey-tracker-app.html file to coaches
2. They double-click to open it in any web browser
3. Data saves automatically in their browser
4. Each coach has their own local copy

PROS: No setup required, works immediately
CONS: Data not shared between coaches, each person has their own data


OPTION 2: GITHUB PAGES (Recommended - FREE)
-------------------------------------------
âœ… Best for: Organization-wide sharing, professional deployment

Step-by-step:
1. Create a GitHub account (free) at github.com
2. Create a new repository (name it: hockey-tracker)
3. Upload hockey-tracker-app.html
4. Go to Settings > Pages
5. Enable GitHub Pages (select main branch)
6. Your app will be live at: https://[your-username].github.io/hockey-tracker/hockey-tracker-app.html

Share that URL with your entire organization!

PROS: Free, professional URL, always accessible, easy updates
CONS: Data still stored locally per browser (not centralized)


OPTION 3: NETLIFY DROP (Super Easy - FREE)
------------------------------------------
âœ… Best for: Fastest deployment with custom domain option

Step-by-step:
1. Go to app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag and drop hockey-tracker-app.html
3. Get instant URL like: https://[random-name].netlify.app
4. Optional: Change to custom domain in settings

PROS: Easiest deployment, free SSL, custom domains
CONS: Random URL unless you customize it


OPTION 4: YOUR ORGANIZATION'S WEBSITE
-------------------------------------
âœ… Best for: Full integration with existing infrastructure

If your organization has a website, ask your web admin to:
1. Create a new page or subdirectory
2. Upload hockey-tracker-app.html
3. Link it from your main navigation

Example: https://waukeshahockey.org/baseline-tracker


DATA SHARING CONSIDERATIONS
===========================

Current Setup (localStorage):
- Each coach's data saves in their own browser
- Perfect for individual coach use
- Easy backup/restore via export/import

To Share Data Between Coaches:
You would need a backend database. Options:
1. Firebase (Google) - easiest backend to add
2. Supabase - open source alternative
3. Your own server with database

Let me know if you want help adding a shared database backend!


RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW
==============================

For Your Organization:

PHASE 1: Pilot Testing (Week 1-2)
â†’ Use Option 1 (file sharing) with 2-3 coaches
â†’ Test functionality and gather feedback
â†’ Each coach uses their own local copy

PHASE 2: Goalie Program Launch (Week 3+)
â†’ Deploy via Option 2 (GitHub Pages) or Option 3 (Netlify)
â†’ Share organization-wide URL
â†’ Coaches can export/import data to share with each other
â†’ Use as official tracking system

PHASE 3: Full Scale (Future)
â†’ Add backend database if multiple coaches need real-time sharing
â†’ Consider custom domain: tracker.yourorganization.com
â†’ Integrate with existing systems


SHARING THE APP WITH YOUR ORGANIZATION
