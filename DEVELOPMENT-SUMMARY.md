---

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with Hooks
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with real-time subscriptions
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Database Schema
Tables defined in [supabase-schema.sql](supabase-schema.sql):
- `players`: id (UUID), name, age_group, position
- `assessments`: id (UUID), player_id (FK), date, season, type, assessor, metrics (JSONB), skill_ratings (JSONB), notes (JSONB)

### Key Improvements Made

#### 1. Bug Fixes
- Fixed ExportData component missing appData prop ([src/App.jsx:174](src/App.jsx#L174))
- Fixed season calculation and filtering in Dashboard

#### 2. Error Handling & UX
- Added loading states during data fetch ([src/App.jsx:140-151](src/App.jsx#L140-L151))
- Added error states with retry functionality ([src/App.jsx:153-170](src/App.jsx#L153-L170))
- Better error messages with specific guidance
- Real-time data synchronization across all clients

#### 3. Testing
- **Test Files**:
  - [src/App.test.jsx](src/App.test.jsx) - App component tests
  - [src/components/Dashboard.test.jsx](src/components/Dashboard.test.jsx) - Dashboard component tests
  - [src/components/PlayerManagement.test.jsx](src/components/PlayerManagement.test.jsx) - Player management tests
- **Coverage**: 13 tests covering core functionality
- **Status**: All tests passing ✅

#### 4. Performance Optimization
- Implemented code splitting with React.lazy for Reports and ExportData components
- Manual chunk splitting in [vite.config.js](vite.config.js):
  - `react-vendor`: React core libraries (163 KB)
  - `chart`: Chart.js (158 KB) - lazy loaded
  - `supabase`: Supabase client (148 KB)
- **Before**: Single 501 KB bundle
- **After**: Multiple optimized chunks with lazy loading
- Main bundle reduced to ~21 KB with Chart.js loaded only when needed

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages
Configured for GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions:
- Workflow: [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- Base path: `/codespaces-react-1/` (configured in [vite.config.js](vite.config.js))
- 404 handling: SPA redirect script generated via [generate-404.cjs](generate-404.cjs)
- Secrets required:
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Environment Setup
1. Copy [.env.example](.env.example) to `.env`
2. Add your Supabase project URL and anon key
3. Run database migrations from [supabase-schema.sql](supabase-schema.sql)

---

## Available Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm test           # Run tests
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

## Future Enhancement Ideas

### High Priority
1. **Edit Assessments**: Allow editing of previously saved assessments
2. **Player Photos**: Upload and display player photos
3. **Comparison View**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple players
4. **Export to PDF**: Generate professional PDF reports

### Medium Priority
5. **Team Management**: Group players into teams
6. **Goal Tracking**: Track progress toward specific development goals
7. **Assessment Templates**: Create reusable assessment templates
8. **Video Integration**: Link video clips to specific assessments

### Low Priority
9. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
10. **Dark Mode**: Theme switching
11. **Offline Mode**: PWA with offline capabilities
12. **Email Reports**: Send reports directly to parents/players

---

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Non-Critical
- React Router v7 migration warnings (future flags)
- Test warnings about state updates not wrapped in `act()`
  - These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality
  - Will be addressed in future React Router update
